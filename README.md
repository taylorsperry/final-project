# Foto Finder

Foto Finder is a web application that utilizes the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to generate one random "feature" image and display 10 photos related to a user's search query. It's the first application I've built in Vue.js and [it's deployed to Heroku here.](https://deploy-foto.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation 
```git clone https://github.com/taylorsperry/final-project.git```

```npm install``` from the root directory

Request an API key from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers)

From the root directory add a file named .env and add VUE_APP_APIKEY=*your API key here*
  
```npm run serve``` and visit localhost:8080 in your browser
